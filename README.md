## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start - Let's Get This Party Started!

- npm or yarn (Your package manager of choice - we don't judge)

### Installation (The Fun Part)

```bash
# Clone this beauty
git clone https://github.com/your-org/edu-analytics-dashboard.git
cd edu-analytics-dashboard

# Install the good stuff
npm install

# Environment setup (keep your secrets safe!)
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your Supabase credentials - they're like the secret sauce!

npm run dev
```

## 🎨 Customization - Make It Your Own

This isn't a one-size-fits-all solution (because education isn't either):

```typescript
// Want to add your own metrics? Easy!
const customMetrics = {
  studentSatisfaction: '🌟',
  employmentRates: '💼', 
  coffeeConsumption: '☕' // Because let's be real, this matters
}
```
